# Exercise: Add Feature to Remove Items

Checkout the exercise branch on your computer and install dependencies:

```
$ git checkout 05-exercise_remove-item
$ npm install
```

A new feature request has come in - users want to be able to delete embarassing items forever.

Being a good TDD developer the test has already been created, but it fails. To run the tests:

```
$ node test/store.js
```

Add new actions and update reducers to make the test pass.

When you're done commit and push your changes.
