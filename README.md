# Exercise: Use `createAction` and `handleActions`

Checkout the exercise branch on your computer and install dependencies:

```
$ git checkout 14-exercise_redux-actions
$ npm install
```

Your colleague was recently fired over an argument about semi-colons. They had started refactoring the app to use `redux-actions` but didn't complete the work.

Continue the refactoring so all actions are created and handled using redux-actions. All the tests must pass.

* Hint: `createAction` can take a function
* Hint: `handleActions` (plural) can create a reducer that handles multiple actions.
