# Exercise: Parameterized Action Creators

Checkout the exercise branch on your computer:

```
$ git checkout 03-exercise_action-creators
```

A new feature request has come in - users want to be able to multiply numbers by any factor.

Add an action and corresponding handler to the reducer to make the new unit tests pass.

When you're done commit and push your changes.

Hint: Actions can carry more than just a `type` value.
